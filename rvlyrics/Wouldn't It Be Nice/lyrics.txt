Wouldn't it be nice if we were older?
Then we wouldn't have to wait so long
And wouldn't it be nice to live together
In the kinda world where we belong?
You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together
Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new?
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through
An' happy times together we'd be spending,
I wish that every kiss was never ending
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray
It might come true (run, run, we-ooh)
Baby, then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Oh, we could be married (oh, we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Bah ba ba bah ba ba bah
Bah ba ba bah ba ba bah
You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But let's talk about it
Oh, wouldn't it be nice?
Goodnight, b' b' baby
Sleep tight, b' b' baby
