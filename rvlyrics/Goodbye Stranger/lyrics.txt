It was an early morning yesterday
I was up before the dawn
And I really have enjoyed my stay
But I must be movin' on
Like a king without a castle
Like a queen without a throne
I'm an early morning lover
And I must be movin' on
Now I believe in what you say
Is the undisputed truth
But I have to have things my own way
To keep me in my youth
Like a ship without an anchor (ooh)
Like a man without a name
Just the thought of those sweet ladies (ooh)
Sends a shiver through my veins
And I will go on shining (ooh)
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me (ooh)
My troubles will be few
Goodbye stranger it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain
An' sweet devotion,
It's not for me
Just give me motion
And set me free
In the land and the ocean
Far away
It's the life I've chosen
Every day
So goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Now some they do and some they don't
And some you just can't tell
And some they will and some they won't
With some it's just as well
You can laugh at my behavior
And that'll never bother me
Say the devil is my savior
But I don't pay no heed
And I will go on shining
Shining like brand new
I'll never look behind me
My troubles will be few
Goodbye, stranger, it's been nice
Hope you find your paradise
Tried to see your point of view
Hope your dreams will all come true
Goodbye Mary, goodbye Jane
Will we ever meet again?
Feel no sorrow, feel no shame
Come tomorrow, feel no pain
And sweet devotion,
It's not for me
Just give me motion
And set me free
In the land and the ocean
Far away
It's the life I've chosen
Every day
So now I'm leaving
Got to go
Hit the road
I'll say it once again,
Oh yes I'm leavin'
Got to go, got to go now
I'm sorry, I must tell you goodbye Mary,
Goodbye Jane.
Will we ever meet again?
