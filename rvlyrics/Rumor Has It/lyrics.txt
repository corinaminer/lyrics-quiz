She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
She made a fool out of you, and boy she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but she's cold to the core.
Now rumor has it, she ain't got your love anymore

Rumor has it! (rumor)...

Don't forget me, I beg (rumor has it!)
I remember you said (rumor has it!)
I heard that you settled down (ooh...)
That you found a girl and you're married now (ooh...)
I heard that your dreams came true (ooh...)
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

Whoa, rumor has it! (rumor)...
Yeah, baby!
Don't forget me, I beg (rumor has it!)
I remember you said (rumor has it!)

Never mind, I'll find someone like you (rumor has it!)
I wish nothing but the best for you two (rumor has it!)
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
