She, she ain't real
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history, or don't you remember?
Sure, she's got it all
But baby, is that really what you want?

Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you, and boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it, she ain't got your love anymore

rumor has it, ooh ooh
rumor has it, ooh ooh
rumor has it, ooh ooh
rumor has it, ooh ooh

Don't forget me, I beg (rumor has it, rumor has it)
I remember you said (rumor has it, rumor has it, rumor has it)
I heard that you settled down (ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
That you've found a girl and you're married now (ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
I heard that your dreams came true (ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you (ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

Woah, rumor has it (rumor has it, rumor has it)
Yeah, baby (rumor has it, rumor has it)

(rumor has it) Don't forget me
(rumor has it) I beg
(rumor has it) I remember you said
(rumor has it, rumor has it)

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me, and boy, you're bringin' me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

(rumor has it, rumor has it) Yeah...
(rumor has it, rumor has it) Yeah...

(rumor has it) Don't forget me
(rumor has it) I beg
(rumor has it) I remember you said
(rumor has it)

(rumor has it, rumor has it) Hey heeeey, yeah
(rumor has it, rumor has it) rumor has it

(rumor has it) Don't forget me
(rumor has it) I beg
(rumor has it) I remember you said
(rumor has it)

Never mind, I'll find someone like you (rumor has it)
I wish nothing but the best for you, too (rumor has it)

Don't forget me, I beg (rumor has it, rumor has it)
I remember you said (rumor has it)

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
