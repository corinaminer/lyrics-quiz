I love the colorful clothes she wears
And the way the sunlight plays upon her hair
I hear the sound of a gentle word
On the wind that lifts her perfume through the air
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me the excitations (ooh bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (good vibrations, bop bop)...
She's giving me the excitations (excitations)
Close my eyes, she's somehow closer now
Softly smile, I know she must be kind
When I look in her eyes
She goes with me to a blossom world
I'm pickin' up good vibrations
She's giving me excitations (ooh bop bop)
I'm pickin' up good vibrations (good vibrations, bop bop)...
She's giving me excitations (excitations)
Ah
Oh, my, my, what elation
I don't know where, but you send me there
Oh, my, my, what sensation
Oh, my, my, what elation
Oh, my, my, what e
Gotta keep those lovin' good vibrations a-happenin' with her
Ah
Good, good, good, good vibrations (bop bop)...
Ba ba da ba da ba ba da ba da...
Good vibrations,
