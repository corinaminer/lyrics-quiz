[tb] Sometimes I'm right and I can be wrong
My own beliefs are in my song
[sa] The butcher, a banker, the drummer and then
Makes no difference what group I'm in
[satb] I am everyday people
[sa] There is a blue one who can't accept the green one
For living with a fat one, tryin' to be a skinny one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby.
[satb] Ooh sha sha
[] We got to live together!
[tb] I am no better and neither are you
We are the same whatever we do
[satb] You love me, you hate me, you know me and then
You can't figure out the bag I'm in
I am everyday people
[sa] There is a long hair that doesn't like the short hair
For bein' such a rich one, that will not help the poor one
And different strokes for different folks
And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby.
[satb] Ooh sha sha
[] We got to live together!
[sa] There is a yellow one that won't accept the black one
That won't accept the red one, that won't accept the white one [tb] (ooh ooh)
[sa] And different strokes for different folks [tb] (ooh ooh)
[sa] And so on and so on and scooby dooby dooby [tb] (ooh ooh)
[satb] Ooh sha sha
I am everyday people.
