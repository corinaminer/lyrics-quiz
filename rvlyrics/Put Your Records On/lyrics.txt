Three little birds sat on my window,
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes,
We've got it wrong, but it's alright.
The more things seem to change (ooh)
The more they stay the same
Ooh, don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down (yeah)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down (yeah)
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes,
We feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same (ooh)
The more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (yeah)
You go ahead, let your hair down (oh-oh)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down (yeah)
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow.
'Twas more than I could take,
Pity for pity's sake (ooh)
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down (oh, let your hair down)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down (baby let your hair down!)...
Ooh, you're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
