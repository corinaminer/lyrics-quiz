Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete
Maybe sometimes
We got it wrong, but it's alright
The more things seem to change (ooh)
The more they stay the same
Ooh, don't you hesitate
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
Blue as the sky, sunburned and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo
Maybe sometimes
We feel afraid, but it's alright
The more you stay the same (ooh)
The more they seem to change
Don't you think it's strange?
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (yeah)
You go ahead, let your hair down (oh-oh)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow (mm)
Just more than I could take
Pity for pity's sake (ooh)
Some nights kept me awake
I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realize
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to
Girl, put your records on
Tell me your favorite song (oh-oh)
You go ahead, let your hair down (oh, let your hair down)
Sapphire and faded jeans
I hope you get your dreams (hope you get your dreams)
Just go ahead, let your hair down (baby, let your hair down)
Girl, put your records on (yeah)
Tell me your favorite song (oh-oh)
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans (yeah, sapphire and faded jeans)
I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down
Oh, you're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow
