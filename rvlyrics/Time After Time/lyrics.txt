Lying in my bed
I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind
Suitcase of memories
Time after
Sometimes, you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow"
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost, you can look, and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look, and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting (I will be waiting)
Time after time
After my picture fades
And darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside (deep inside)
And the drum beats out of time
If you're lost, you can look, and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look, and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
Time after time
I got a suitcase of memories
I almost left behind
Time after time
Time, time, time
You said (you said)
"Go slow"
But I fall behind (I fall behind)
Time and time and time
Time after time
Oh oh
