I am not a stranger to the dark
Hide away, they say
'Cause we don't want your broken parts.
I've learned to be ashamed of all my scars.
Run away, they say,
No one'll love you as you are.
But, I won't let them break me down to dust.
I know that there's a place for us
For we are glorious.
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out.
I am brave, I am bruised,
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me!
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me!
Oh oh oh oh...
Another round of bullets hits my skin
Well, fire away 'cause today, I won't let the shame sink in.
We are bursting through the barricades and reaching for the sun
We are warriors!
Yeah, that's what we've become.
I won't let them break me down to dust.
I know that there's a place for us,
For we are glorious!
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down (hey hey hey!)
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out (hey hey hey!)
I am brave, I am bruised,
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me.
Look out 'cause here I come (hey hey hey!)
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (hey hey hey!)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me!
Oh oh oh oh...
This is me!
When the sharpest words wanna cut me down
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out.
I am brave, I am bruised,
I am who I'm meant to be, this is me!
Look out 'cause here I come
And I'm marching on to the beat I drum (to the beat I drum)
I'm not scared to be seen
I make no apologies, this is me!
Whenever the words wanna cut me down (oh)
I'll send a flood to drown them out! (oh)
I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out (oh)
Oh oh this is me!
