Let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women, living on the earth
Ties of hope and love, sister and brotherhood
That we are bound together
In our desire to see the world become
A place in which our children can grow free and strong
We are bound together by the task that stands before us
And the road that lies ahead
We are bound, and we are bound
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps, the heart will never rest
shed a little light, oh, Lord
(So that we can see) oh, yeah
(Just a little light, oh, Lord) just a little light, oh, Lord
(Want to stand it on up) stand it on up, oh
(Stand it on up, oh, Lord) stand it on up, oh
(Wanna walk it on down)
Gonna shed a little light (shed a little light, oh, Lord)
Don't see me no light, no dollar bill
(Don't give no light from the TV screen) no, no, no
(When I open my eyes, I want to drink my fill)
(From the well on the hill)
I know you know what I mean
shed a little light, oh, Lord
(So that we can see) oh, yeah
(Just a little light, oh, Lord) just a little light, oh, Lord
(Want to stand it on up) stand it on up, oh
(Stand it on up, oh, Lord) stand it on up, oh
(Wanna walk it on down)
Gonna shed a little light (shed a little light, oh, Lord)
(Shed a little light, oh)
There's a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest, oh yes
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist, oh
And though the body sleeps, the heart will never rest
Let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women, living on the earth
Ties of hope and love, sister and brotherhood
