Let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women, living on the earth
Ties of hope and love, of sister and brotherhood
That we are bound together
In our desire to see the world become
a place in which our children can grow free and strong.
We are bound together by the task that stands before us
And the road that lies ahead
We are bound, and we are bound
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist
And though the body sleeps, the heart will never rest
shed a little light, oh Lord
So that we can see (oh, now, now)
Just a little light, oh, Lord (oh)
Gonna stand it on up
Stand it on up, oh Lord
Stand on up Lord
Gonna walk it on down
Shed a little light, oh Lord
Can't get no light from a dollar bill
Don't get me no light from a TV screen (no, no, no, no)
When I open my eyes, I want to drink my fill
From the well on the hill.
I know you know what I mean!
Shed a little light, oh Lord
So that we can see
Just a little light, oh, Lord (oh)
Gonna stand it on up
Stand it on up, oh Lord
Stand on up Lord
Gonna walk it on down
Shed a little light, oh Lord
There is a feeling like the clenching of a fist
There is a hunger in the center of the chest (ah)
There is a passage through the darkness and the mist (ah)
And though the body sleeps, the heart will never rest
Let us turn our thoughts today to Martin Luther King
And recognize that there are ties between us
All men and women, living on the earth
Ties of hope and love, of sister and brotherhood
